# Options for running

### Option 0: Install Anaconda.

If you haven't installed Anaconda, go here: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

### Option 1: IPython Notebook

If you have installed a distribution like Anaconda or Enthought, you have IPython notebook. To run IPython notebook and to follow along:

- git clone this repo OR download it as a zip and unzip it to your Desktop
- open the terminal/command line and cd into hands-on-analysis-python/notebooks
- in your terminal, type: ipython notebook --pylab 

### Option 2: Code files

If you didn't install these tools with a distribution, you can still run the code files in the code/directory in your terminal. You'll have to uncomment the print statements, and recomment if you wish, as we go.

To run, cd into hands-on-analysis-python/code and type python pandas_lessons.py

### Option 3: Wakari.io

Wakari.io is a platform for web-based Python data analysis. It also allows you to host IPython Notebooks online and share them so people can run IPython Notebook in the browser. To sign up for Wakari:

- go here https://www.wakari.io/

- You should be good to go

### Option 4: Follow along on the web
